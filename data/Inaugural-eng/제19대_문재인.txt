My honored and beloved people!
Thank you. I bow my head in deep gratitude for your great choice.

Today, as the 19th President of the Republic of Korea, I take my first steps toward a new Korea. My shoulders are heavy with the immense responsibility I have been entrusted with by you, the people; my heart is burning with the passion to create a country that has never been experienced before; and my head is full of blueprints to open a new world of integration and coexistence.

The new Korea we are building is the one that our forefathers consistently pursued despite countless setbacks and defeats, and the one that our young people so desperately want to achieve with so much sacrifice and dedication. To build such a Korea, I humbly and fearlessly stand before history and the people of Korea and declare that I will fulfill my responsibility and calling as the 19th President of the Republic of Korea.

I would like to express my gratitude and deepest sympathies to the candidates with whom I campaigned. There are no winners or losers in this election; we are partners who must lead a new Korea together. We must now leave behind the fierce moments of competition and move forward into the future hand in hand.

Honorable citizens!
In the past few months, we have gone through an unprecedented political upheaval. The politics have been chaotic, but the people have been great. Even in the face of the impeachment and imprisonment of our current president, the people have paved the way for our country. Our people were not discouraged, but rather used the call as an opportunity to rise to the occasion and finally opened a new world today. The greatness of Korea is the greatness of its people, and in this presidential election, our people have made history again, choosing a new Korea with unanimous support from all corners of the country. From today, I will be the president of all the people. Even those who did not support me will serve as our people with sincerity. I dare to promise. May 10, 2017 will go down in history as the day when true national unity began.

My honored and beloved people!
In the past difficult years, the people asked if this is the country. President Moon Jae-in will start with that question.
From today, I will be the president who makes the country a country. I will boldly break with the wrong practices of the old era. I will be new from the presidency.
As soon as I am ready, I will leave the Blue House and usher in the era of the Gwanghwamun presidency. I will have head-to-head discussions with my staff. I will communicate with the people frequently. I will brief the media on major issues myself. I will stop by the market on my way home from work and have casual conversations with citizens I meet. I will sometimes hold grand debates in Gwanghwamun Square. I will share the imperial power of the presidency as much as possible.
I will make the power agencies completely independent of politics. I will create checks and balances so that no agency can exercise unchecked power. I will work from a low position.

I will be a president who stands at eye level with the people.
I will urgently resolve security crises and work for peace on the Korean Peninsula.
I will fly to Washington as soon as necessary. I will go to Beijing and Tokyo, and if conditions permit, I will go to Pyongyang. I will do everything I can to settle peace on the Korean Peninsula. I will strengthen the U.S.-ROK alliance, and I will negotiate seriously with the United States and China to resolve the THAAD issue. Strong security starts with a strong national defense. We will work to strengthen our national defense. We will also lay the foundation for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. By establishing a peace structure in Northeast Asia, we will lay the foundation for easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
We will also change the politics of division and conflict. The conflict between conservatives and liberals must end. The president will take the initiative to talk directly to the opposition. The opposition is a partner in governing. We will regularize dialogues and meet frequently.
I will appoint talented people evenly across the country. I will make competence and the right place the guiding principles of personnel selection. I will select and recruit talented people regardless of whether they support me or not, and entrust them with the job.
The economy is difficult inside and outside the country. People's lives are also difficult. As I promised during the campaign, I will take care of jobs first and foremost. At the same time, I will take the lead in reforming the chaebol.
In the era of the Moon Jae-in administration, the term "cronyism" will completely disappear. We will resolve conflicts between regions, classes, and generations, and find a way to solve the problem of temporary workers. We will create a world without discrimination.

I say it again.
Under Moon Jae-in and the Democratic Party of Korea, opportunities will be equal.
The process will be fair.
The outcome will be just.

Honorable people!
This presidential election was held after the impeachment of the previous president. The history of "unfortunate presidents" continues. Starting with the Moon administration, this unfortunate history must come to an end. I will be a new example of a Korean president. I will do my best to become a successful president judged by the people and history. I will repay your support with that.
I will be a clean president. I will be a president who takes office empty-handed and leaves office empty-handed. I will be a president who returns to his hometown and becomes an ordinary citizen and lives with his neighbors. I will remain the pride of the people.
I will be an honest president who keeps his promises. I will carefully check the promises I made during the election process and keep them. True political development will only be possible if the president leads by example. I will not loudly promise to do the impossible. I will say what is wrong is wrong. I will not cover up unfavorable public opinion with lies.
I will be a fair president. I will create a world without privilege and cheating. I will create a world where common sense pays off.
I will not turn a blind eye to the pain of my neighbors. I will make sure that no one is left behind. I will be the president who wipes away the tears of the people.
I will be a president who communicates. I will become a lowly person, a humble power, and create the most powerful country. I will not be a president who rules and rules, but a president who communicates and communicates.
I will be the 'President of the Gwanghwamun Era' and stay close to the people. I will remain a warm president and a friend.

My beloved and honored people!
Today, May 10, 2017, the Republic of Korea begins again. The history that makes a country a country begins. Please join us on this path. I will dedicate my life's work.
Thank you.
