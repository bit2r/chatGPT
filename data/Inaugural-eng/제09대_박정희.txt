Dear 50 million compatriots!

And distinguished guests at home and abroad!

At this moment when a new chapter of history is unfolding before our eyes as we look forward to the long-awaited 80s, we are gathered here today with swelling dreams of national grandeur and renewed resolve.

In this rewarding journey of the founding of Jungheung, where the whole nation's persistence and sweat are young, the shining golden towers built in the 60s of development and the 70s of advancement are clearly visible to us tomorrow as the magnificent and proud image of a rich and advanced Korea.

Therefore, the 80s, which we challenge from now on, will be an era of grandeur, full of confidence and pride in creating a new history.

It is the time to build a highly industrialized nation, to join the ranks of the advanced nations with pride, and to build a welfare society full of recognition and loyalty amidst prosperity and abundance.

We must become a great solidarity that once again marks the flowering of national culture in our history by utilizing our accumulated national strength and wisdom.

Thus, by achieving a breakthrough in the peaceful reunification of our country, we should uphold the authenticity of our long-established national history and actively contribute to the march of human history toward peace, stability and prosperity.

Having assumed the heavy responsibilities of the ninth president at such a majestic watershed in our nation's history, I firmly pledge to my country and people that I will always stand in solidarity with all the people who live together in these times, and that I will accept and devote myself to the solemn calling given to our generation.

People!

Any nation can only flourish if its goals are clear, its ideals are lofty, and its people are strong and united in their determination to fulfill them.

This is a simple truth of history.

Looking back, we, who were mired in poverty, stagnation, despondency, and lethargy after the June 25 Uprising, rose up in the early 60s with the electricity of a solvent engineer.

As we gradually regained vigor and order in all aspects of national affairs, we set a clear goal of self-renewal and set off on a brisk pace.

We have worked and worked and worked with an indomitable determination and will to make our own way in the world, and with a strong sense of mission to bequeath a worthy legacy to our beloved descendants.

In the past decade, our society has undergone a tremendous transformation.

The miracle of the Great Wall of China has happened.

What others took a century or centuries to accomplish, we have accomplished in just 15 or 6 years.

The national march to modernize the homeland is still going strong today.

Our country, which was a traditional agrarian society until the early 60s, is now transitioning from a medium-sized industrialized country to a highly industrialized one.

Our economy, which was dependent on foreign aid for daily necessities, is now almost self-reliant, and our defense industry, which could not make a single rifle with its own hands, is about to enter the era of domestically produced long-range guided munitions.

The Saemaul movement, which has been blowing in the rural areas of our country since the early 70s, has laid a firm foundation for accelerating the cultivation of national power by encouraging the entire nation to carry out a mental revolution of diligence, self-help and cooperation, and maximizing the totalization and streamlining of the nation through the theocratic reform of state affairs.

Based on the tremendous strength of the Korean people, the Republic of Korea has grown at a pace unparalleled in the world, establishing a self-reliant economy and a foundation for self-defense, and has emerged as the Korea of the world.

Now, our national power has come to dominate North Korea.

In silence, I can't help but feel overwhelmed as I look back at the hardships and trials we have endured to reach this point.

I would like to express my sincere praise and gratitude to you, the people of Korea, with infinite pride in the footsteps of this great nation.

My fellow Koreans!

The road ahead of us from now on will not be a smooth one.

The behavior of great powers is revealing the fluidity of a more diverse and complex international power politics.

In many parts of the world, new tensions and conflicts are brewing, and there have been subtle changes in the neighborhood on the Korean Peninsula that foreshadow new trials.

In addition, fierce competition will increase by the day amid the instability of the international economic order.

As our international status rises and our national power stretches out into the world, new barriers and challenges will appear before us in terms of international competition, including trade and resource issues.

In addition, as people's lives improve, their expectations will rise sharply in proportion.

However, we must be able to regulate ourselves and have the wisdom and courage to boldly fight and win the internal challenges, such as pride and complacency, luxury and wastefulness that are prone to sprout in our hearts.

We can't afford to let our guard down for a moment, and we can't afford to be complacent about the state of affairs around us.

In the midst of the whirlwind of change, we must never forget that we are the masters of our own destiny.

Based on the independence and national strength of the Korean people, we will proactively adapt to any changes and challenges at home and abroad, and work together with all nations in the world to pursue peace and prosperity.

Looking back, our ancestors did not give up in the face of repeated national difficulties, but rather rose like a phoenix, using them as a springboard for their efforts and advancement.

We can proudly recall times like the unified Silla and the time of King Sejong the Great, when the national fortunes flourished and the national spirit was high.

We have roots in history, tradition, and culture.

We are now living in this era to realize national revitalization.

Therefore, I will continue to focus our important policy indicators on the achievement of a fully self-reliant economy, the establishment of a self-defense posture, the expansion of social development, and the cultivation of spiritual culture.

I will also devote myself to peacefully reunifying the divided country and creating a new history of national revitalization.

My fellow citizens!

We must now build on the momentum of the progress we have made so far and establish the foundation of a strong nation like a rock as soon as possible.

A self-reliant economy and self-defense are not only the basis for establishing sovereignty, but also the foundation for peace and prosperity.

In order to build a highly industrialized society based on heavy and chemical industries and raise science and technology to the world level, we will focus our efforts on education to produce high-quality brains, while spurring the balanced development of urban and rural areas.

In addition, we will establish an all-out security posture with the patriotic spirit and active cooperation of the entire population, and realize self-defense with the help of an increasingly advanced defense industry.

Based on the traditional values of hard work and cooperation, we will continue to expand social development policies so that those who live diligently and sincerely can receive preferential treatment and enjoy rewards, and utilize their own qualities and abilities.

Thus, making it possible for all citizens to live well in a bright and rewarding living environment is the future vision of national life that we are pursuing.

The foundation of a sound nation and a sound society is the establishment of a sound national spirit and social discipline.

A sound society must also be based on the preservation of cultural traditions and spiritual heritage inherited by our ancestors and the creative development of a dignified national culture.

Building a prosperous and dignified society for all of us at the home of the splendid Jinshu River Mountain will not only be a proud legacy to pass on to future generations, but also a way to contribute to the common good of mankind.

To succeed in this daunting task, we must steadily build and develop a political system that is effective in solving our problems, based on a foundation of orderly freedom.

We must work even harder to ensure that a clean and productive democratic polity is ingrained in our national life, where people from all walks of life participate in the development of the country with their own creativity and dedication.

Dear compatriots at home and abroad!

Now that our national power has increased to this extent in all fields, and we have a clear direction and goal to move forward uninterruptedly, I believe that the issue of the reunification of the Fatherland, which is our ideal national task, will inevitably enter a new phase.

In the end, the North Koreans will have no choice but to accept our offer and come to the table for dialog.

In the mainstream of national history, the North Korean communists, who are nothing more than a fringe heresy, will not always be able to defy and obstruct the unwavering wishes of 50 million Koreans.

We have endured so many unbearable things to build up the strength of Wasin Counseling in the hope of resolving the unity of Korea, which has been divided into North and South for more than 30 years.

On the one hand, I will always keep the door of dialogue open to the North Korean side, and on the other hand, I am convinced that only the cultivation of our strong national power is the shortcut to peaceful reunification, and I vow to continue to make all kinds of efforts for this purpose.

Thus, we will inevitably drive the shadow of war from our land, firmly establish peace, and usher in a new era of solidarity for the realization of a unified Korea.

Dear people!

Observing the place that today occupies in the history of our glorious nation, I am conscious of the solemn and enormous responsibility of leading the march of the glorious people, and I would like to once again call for the unreserved cooperation of the entire nation.

We must never forget the lesson of unity that we learned just a few years ago, when we organized ourselves and wisely overcame the crisis that followed the global oil crisis and the submergence of the Indian Ocean peninsula.

Let us all rekindle the thundering steps of reform, creation and progress that echo in every direction, and keep the torch of our nation burning brightly in today's turbulent and testing world.
