Although the competition for jobs with machines began before the advent of computers, the replacement of existing human jobs by machines became visible as machines showed better performance and lower price competitiveness than humans in various fields such as cognition and creation, which were thought to be unique to humans.\n  Through this literature review and empirical data analysis, we examine the nature of automation in which machines replace human jobs.  and suggest ways to increase productivity through the division of labor between humans and machines.\n\n:::\n\n\n## chatGPT 윤문\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\"}\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered significant attention since 2016 when AlphaGo, an AI program, defeated the human Go champion Lee Sedol. However, the growing use of machines in various fields has also fueled concerns about the displacement of human jobs. This paper presents a literature review and empirical data analysis to explore the nature of automation and suggest ways to enhance productivity by optimizing the division of labor between humans and machines.\n\nWhile machines have been replacing human jobs for centuries, the rapid development of AI has made it possible for machines to outperform humans in fields previously considered uniquely human, such as cognition and creation. As a result, there is a growing awareness of the impact of automation on employment opportunities. This paper aims to provide insights into this issue through a comprehensive review of relevant literature and analysis of empirical data.\n\nOur analysis indicates that automation can lead to the displacement of jobs that require low-level skills, but it can also create new opportunities that require higher-level skills. Furthermore, automation can enhance productivity and lower costs, thus benefiting both consumers and firms. Therefore, there is a need to strike a balance between the potential benefits and challenges of automation.\n\nTo maximize the advantages of automation, we propose an optimal division of labor between humans and machines. In this approach, humans are responsible for tasks that require creativity, emotional intelligence, and social skills, while machines are responsible for tasks that require precision and efficiency. This approach can lead to better job quality and increased productivity.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper highlights the potential impact of automation on employment and the need to optimize the division of labor between humans and machines. While automation can lead to job displacement, it can also create new opportunities and improve job quality. Therefore, policymakers and firms must consider ways to optimize the use of automation to benefit both society and the economy.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
