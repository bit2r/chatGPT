1. Baroque: The Baroque style was popular in Europe from the late 16th to the early 18th century. Baroque paintings are known for their dramatic lighting, intense emotions, and dynamic compositions.

1. Impressionism: Impressionism was a modernist movement in French painting in the late 19th century. Impressionist paintings are known for their loose brushstrokes, light-filled compositions, and focus on capturing fleeting moments.

1. Surrealism: Surrealism was a cultural movement in the 20th century that aimed to liberate the imagination and explore the subconscious. Surrealist paintings are known for their dreamlike and fantastical imagery.

1. Abstract Expressionism: Abstract Expressionism was a modernist movement in American painting in the mid-20th century. Abstract Expressionist paintings are known for their large canvases, gestural brushstrokes, and emphasis on the process of creation.

These are just a few examples of famous painting styles in history. There are many other styles that have influenced and shaped the course of art history.
